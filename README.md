# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
"# Wobot-Project" 


Instructions to reproduce the project:

    Step 1: Clone the git repository.

    Step 2: After cloning the project, run the following command:

            npm install

            This will install all the dependencies.

    Step 3: Create a .env file and put the following :

            VITE_GET_API = {API endpoint for fatching camera data}

            VITE_TOKEN = {Bearer token for authentication}
